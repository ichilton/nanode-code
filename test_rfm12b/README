Sketches for testing RFM12B radio modules with Arduino's, Nanode's or Wi-Node's

test_tx - Transmitter
test_rx - Receiver

Requires Arduino version 0022. v1.0 was just released a few days ago so
i'll need to update this to work with 1.0.

Requires the Ports and RF12 libraries from Jeelabs in your libraries directory:
